<h5>Skeena is a cultivar of cherry originating in Canada.</h5>

 <br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivar history &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
      <dl>
        <dd>The deliciously smelling, spring blooms of the Skeena Cherry are followed by juicy, commercial grade cherries that are ready to harvest during the late summer months. These cherries are large and resistant to cracking, so you get to keep more of the cherries you grow. Plus, they‚Äôre ideal for preserving in jams or baking into your favorite cherry recipes.

Also, the Skeena Cherry Tree is low maintenance and self-fertile. That means you don‚Äôt have to plant this cherry tree with a companion in order to have prolific quantities of fruit. It also means that it's ideal for planting with other cherry trees that aren't self-fertile.</dt><br>
<br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tree Characteristic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
        <dd>The Stella cherry tree is a vase-shaped tree with a mature height of about 20‚Äì30 feet and a spread of about 15 feet. The tree blossoms early and fruits early, with moderate to heavy crops. Though it is considered a universal pollinator for other sweet cherry varieties, it has been found to not pollinate the Bing cherry variety in some regions.The tree can grow well in USDA Hardiness Zones 5‚Äì8. </dd>
<br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fruit Characteristics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
        <dd>The fruit of the Stella cultivar is large, heart-shaped, and dark red, with overall excellent quality.[9] It ripens about 1 week earlier than Bing.</dd>
<br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compact Stella&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
        <dd>A compact version of Stella was developed through X-ray irradiation of dormant Stella scions in 1964 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. This semi-dwarf variety of the cultivar grows to about half the size of the parent variety. It retains the parent variety's self-fertility and fruits early and heavily. It was named "Compact Stella" in 1973</dd>
